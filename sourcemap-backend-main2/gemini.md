# make sure to strictly follow these rulesets

now when installing a new library ,Strictly  make sure to make use of `uv pip install` rather than just the default `pip install`

i want this application to run via uvicorn, not with docker compose, for my database which i am using postgres, make sure to request for a postgres connection string as part of the .env variables

Strictly avoid the use of special characters (like ✓ and ✗) and Strictly avoid the use of  emojis inside the code


I don't want you to run the development server, i am already running it in another terminal
