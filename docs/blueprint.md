## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich blue (#1E40AF), inspired by Airbnb, for trust and authority.
- Background color: Light blue (#DBEAFE) to provide a clean and professional feel.
- Accent color: Purple (#8B5CF6) as Airbnb uses, to differentiate interactive elements and highlights, diverging from the n8n scheme which uses green/blue gradients to present connections in a data flow or node-based interface
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a versatile sans-serif, for a clean and highly legible design reminiscent of both Airbnb and n8n.
- Utilize Lucide React icons, sized appropriately for various UI elements, using status colors (green, yellow, red) to represent different states.
- Emphasize a clean and professional layout, influenced by Airbnb and n8n, featuring a mobile-first design with clearly defined sections and whitespace. The interfaces for both platforms are relatively minimalist.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and loading states to improve user experience, ensuring that these animations do not distract from the core task, inspired by n8n and Airbnb's smooth interactions.
